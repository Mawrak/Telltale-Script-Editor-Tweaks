# Limitations

- Currently, the script editor only supports The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series, however, more support is planned for future updates. Pull requests are welcome!
- Presently only runs on windows as `ttarchext` is required to build ttarch2 archives. We're working on a custom solution to make this an issue of the past!
