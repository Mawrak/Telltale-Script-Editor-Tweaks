An experimental script editor for Telltale games.

![Editor Window](/Screenshots/editor.png?raw=true)

# Limitations

- Currently, the script editor only supports The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series, however, more support is planned for future updates. Pull requests are welcome!

- Mod installation methods are up to the mod creator. We're looking to build out a standardized format, although this is on hold until our Mod Installer (found at https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/Telltale-Mod-Installer) is complete. I (violet) personally bundle batch files with my mods currently, although manual installations & other, way fancier implementations are possible.

# Special Thanks

Thanks to [Lightning](https://twitter.com/nekoblitz_) and [Hamilton Productions](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlackBoxKid) for designing & coloring the program icon respectively.
